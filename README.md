# Colour Switcher

A simple colour switcher application. The inspiration for this project was taken from jsbeginners.com. As the user clicks the button, the JavaScript function randomly selects an index of an array of colours and changes the background of the page. The text value inside the button also changes to the name of the colour that is currently displayed.

# One Rep Max (1RM) Calculator 

A calculation tool for weightlifters. The user inputs the weight of any given exercise and calculates their estimated one rep max presented in either pounds (lbs) or kilograms (kgs). Future changes include adding percentages of the user's one rep max in order to train for different purposes. 

# "War" RNG

A random number generator that mimics a combat scenario in a role-playing game. It compares two numbers against eachother within a range (1-600) that represent attack values for the player and "boss". The higher number wins and the user is greeted with a message: either "You Died" or "You Defeated".
