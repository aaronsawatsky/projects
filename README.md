# "War" RNG

A random number generator that mimics a combat scenario in a role-playing game. It compares two numbers against eachother within a range (1-600) that represent attack values for the player and "boss". The higher number wins and the user is greeted with a message: either "You Died," or "You Defeated" (via "Dark Souls").
