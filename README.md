# One Rep Max (1RM) Calculator 

A calculation tool for weightlifters. The user inputs the weight of any given exercise and calculates their estimated one rep max presented in either pounds (lbs) or kilograms (kgs). Future changes include adding percentages of the user's one rep max in order to train for different purposes. 

# "War" RNG

A random number generator that mimics a combat scenario in a role-playing game. It compares two numbers against eachother within a range (1-600) that represent attack values for the player and "boss". The higher number wins and the user is greeted with a message: either "You Died" or "You Defeated".
